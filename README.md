## DISCLAIMER
> This game was build 5 years ago and since then the audio player from pygame seems to be glitchy.

In its current version (1.1.0) the game is finished and fully playable. However, nobody is is safe from bugs, and if you encounter any, well I hope they won't be so frustrating.
Although this game is insanely exciting, it is far from being finished and new features are in active development, like:
- being able to crouch/descend from platforms
- gradual jumping
- changing avatars - with different properties
- more relevant damage animation
- more creatures
- level 2
- better sound system

Other levels are also in development.
Passwords are available on request.
